# About the project

As the title suggest the game will be focused around the work of a Reactor Engineer, the player will basically have to take care of a reactor by managing it (producing electricity and making sure it doesnt blow up!!!) and of course repairing the reactor and its many different components.

Hence the player will have the ability to touch and push a lot of different buttons but also interact with different objects in the game to repaire or exchange components of said reactor.

and all in VR of course!

I decided to make this little game because on one side I love Engineering games, having to repair and manage systems but also to improuve my VR programming, mostly interacting with objects and creating different interaction ( Pushing buttons / Opening panels / exchanging objects / repairing Objects etc...)

This should give you a better Idea of how the game will look like. This is the Main Reactor Control Panel from where the player will manage the energy production (the reactor output and the reactor temperature) He will do this by pushing lots and lots of buttons to try and keep the reactor stable! 

On this Control Panel you can already see the different types of Possible interactions as there are ofc Buttons/Light Signals/Removable Panels/places for Information UI's etc... 

I will Hopefully Upload more about this project soon!!Stay Tuned :D
