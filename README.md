# About the project

As the title suggest the Game will be focused around the work of a Reactor Engineer, the player will basically have to take care of a reactor by managing it (producing electricity and making sure it doesnt blow up!) and of course repairing the reactor and its many components
Hence the player will have the ability to touch and push a lot of different buttons but also interact with different objects in the game to repaire or exchange components of said reactor.
and all in VR of course!
